# The blog in its current form is a bit buggy and still requires work. At the moment
clicking on a post will log in a user- not great. I also feel that the UX flow is pretty
sad. Outside of that the blog can create and remove a user. User can create, edit,
and delete a post. A user can add, edit, and delete a comment on another user's post.
